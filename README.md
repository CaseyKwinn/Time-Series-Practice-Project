# Time-Series-Practice-Project

This was another project I did alongside a course. While many of the concepts were new to me, like seasonality, trend, holt linear model, holt winter model, ARIMA model, stationarity testing, and so on, I was able to get a pretty good understanding of what they are and how to use them in a suprisingly short amount of time. I can't say this makes me confidently able to repeat everything I did here, but I can say that this was a tremendous leap forward in my skills, and was even a lot of fun whenever I wasn't banging my head against a wall.

Side note: I tried to better document my steps and progress this time around. While this may have slowed the process down a bit, it helped some of the ideas sink in, and I'm sure it will help a lot in the future when I revisit this project to see what I did.
