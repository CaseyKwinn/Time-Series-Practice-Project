# Time-Series-Practice-Project

This was another project I did alongside a course. While many of the concepts were new to me, like seasonality, trend, holt linear model, holt winter model, ARIMA model, stationarity testing, and so on, I was able to get a pretty good understanding of what they are and how to use them in a suprisingly short amount of time. I can't say this makes me confidently able to repeat everything I did here, but I can say that this was a tremendous leap forward in my skills, and was even a lot of fun whenever I wasn't banging my head against a wall.
